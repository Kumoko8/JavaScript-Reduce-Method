//Reducer accumluates values through an array
//for example if the array is nums = [2, 4, 6, 8] the reducer, starting at 0(accum) would take the first value (curr) and add it to 0
//0 + 2
//2 + 4
//6 + 6
//12 + 8 and the final value would be 20
//basically it gives a total of all the values in an array
